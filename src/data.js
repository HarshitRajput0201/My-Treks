The highest peak of the state of Maharashtra at 5,400 feet or 1646 meters above the sea level high provides breathtaking views across all of Bhandardara. The Kalsubai Temple is at the mountain's peak, and pilgrims from nearby villages come to take her blessings. It's believed that a young village girl called Kalsubai lived in those hills. She used to cure villagers and animals and help with pursuits like agriculture. One day the girl left for the summit, but nevermore returned, so to remember her, the villagers built this small temple on her home on the mountainside while the main temple was built on the mountain's peak.

The third edge towards the west is inclined at an angle of 75 degrees. A one-meter wide rocky staircase with niches in it is carved out for ascending & descending the Hari har gad Fort.There are 117 steps in all. After you climb the first rocky staircase main entrance, we walk below an overhang with a sheer drop. Again one has to climb a set of steep stairs with niches, then pass thru a staircase inside the rock-like Peth Fort or Kothaligad Fort and then reach the top of the Fort. The view from the top is excellent. After climbing these steps, we get up to the entrance door. The Fort Harihar Nashik has got a tapering plateau with a raised level in the middle. There is a small temple of Lord Hanuman and Lord Shiva on the plateau. A small pond is there in front of this temple. Water from this pond can be used for drinking."

It is located in the district of Ahmednagar and is located about 4255 feet above sea level. It lies in the Ajoba mountain range surrounded by great mountains of Kulang, Alang, Kalsubai, Katarabai, Ajoba and Ghanchakkar. Geographically Ratangad is at the banks of Bhandardara lake of Ahmednagar district. With views of lake and highest mountains in Sahyadris looks very much lost in time. At the base of this fort is ancient Lord Shiva (Amruteshwar) temple. About 1000 years old temple of Lord Shiva, the Amruteshwar Temple at Ratanwadi, is an absolute paragon of high class architecture of our ancestors."

The central place situated inside the fort was constructed mainly out of wood. However, apart from its base, made up of pillars, hardly anything else remains. One can also be witness to the ruins of the three watchtowers, which were once used to spot any threat from a distance."

It is one of the three forts, the others being Madangad and Kulang, in the Kalsubai range of the Western Ghats. They are the most difficult to reach forts in Nasik District. A dense forest cover make these treks difficult. These three forts are a little neglected due to very heavy rains in the area and a difficult confusing path to the forts. Being in the same region of the three forts its said climb to Kulag is the most difficult. On the way up climbing we come across patches of rock cut steps. It take 6 hours to reach from Kulanwadi to the fort. On the fort to see around 5 water cisterns. Form here we could also see Mahuli with the 3 pinacles. One can also stay at the caves here. The climb preferred is usually between Madan and Alang. The time taken could around 3-4 hours to reach the step after leaving Kulung fort. Over here rock climbing would be required as the wall of the steps was destroyed during the cannon fire. Use of a fixed rope is required. There is one large cave on this fort and 2 water cistern. The top of the fort is a huge plateau. On the fort, there are two caves, a small temple and 11 water cisterns. Remnants of buildings are spread over the fort. Kalasubai, Aundh Fort, Patta and Bitangad are to the east of the fort, Harihar, Trimbakgad and Anjaneri to its north and Harishchandragad, Aajobagad, Khutta (pinnacle), Ratangad and Katrabai to its south."

A cave broached in a vertical wall is home of Bhairavnath temple, which offers the astounding views of surrounding jungle and so many famous spots in Lonavala like Rajmachi, Duke's nose, etc. A trek to Dhak Bahiri Caves is a surprise on every step due to changing terrains from grasslands to plateau walk to dense forest and ending with semi-technical vertical rock patch. Steel wires, fixed ropes have been attached, and steps have been carved in the rock for the safe climb to the caves."
